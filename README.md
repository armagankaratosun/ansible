# My Ansible Playbooks for Installing Stuff

Look at my TODO list for achieved processes. You can assign me more jobs if you want to.

I designed these playbooks to work locally but you can add hosts file to force them to work on distant servers. You can run these stuff with;

```bash
 ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local --ask-sudo-pass apache.yml
```
## TODO

- [x] Ansible playbook for LAMP stack
- [x] Ansible playbook for OhMyZsh!
- [ ] Ansible playbook for Python based things that I use frequently.
- [ ] Ansible playbook for installing i3wm and make configs that I prefer.
- [ ] Generate one Playbook to rule them all.
